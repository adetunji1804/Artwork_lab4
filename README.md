Challenges: Could not mock my database to test the CRUD functions in the application... had to use the 	    actual database
	    I had two version of this application, I wanted to get the grasp of peewee to map class 		    attribute to database (really took time) It was not fun(but worthwile) manipulating the peewee query to 	    achieve my purpose.
